# Golang REST API

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to the **Golang REST API**! This project is an open-source RESTful API built with the Go programming language, designed with a clean and scalable architecture to build robust backend systems.

This project is an evolution and upgrade of the previous [personal-v4](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/personal-v4) project, which utilized Laravel as the backend for the mobile app. By migrating to Go, this API aims to achieve superior scalability and performance, providing a more efficient foundation for the [NovaApp](https://github.com/novaardiansyah/NovaApp) ecosystem.

## Dazzling Tech Stack

- [Go (Golang)](https://go.dev/) - Fast, statically typed, compiled programming language
- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) - Express-inspired web framework for Go
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/) - Fantastic ORM library for Golang
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database Management
- [Validator](https://github.com/thedevsaddam/govalidator) - Go Struct and Field validation

> **Note:** The API documentation provides a complete reference for all available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. Please note that most endpoints require authentication with a personal access token.

## Mobile App Integration

This project is built to work seamlessly with the **NovaApp** mobile application. NovaApp is a modern finance management app built with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript.
